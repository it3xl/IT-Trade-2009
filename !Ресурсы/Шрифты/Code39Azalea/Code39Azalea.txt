Code39Azalea : demo Code 39 TrueType font
Copyright 2005 Jerry Whiting. All rights reserved.

Code39Azalea is a TrueType font that creates Code 39 bar codes. This is a demo font from our C39Tools font package at www.azalea.com/Code39

The full retail version of C39Tools contains 27 different Code 39 barcode fonts, an OCR-B font for the optional human-readable digits, sample code for applications like Crystal Reports, Excel, Access, Visual Basic, C/C++, etc, and full documentation. C39Tools is available for Windows, the Macintosh, Linux, UNIX, and other platforms.

C39Azalea is a subset of the full 44-character set. It contains the digits 0-9 and the asterisk used as the start and stop bar. Create barcodes by adding an asterisk before and after your numeric string. Format "*314159265*" in Code39Azalea and it will scan as "314159265".

The point size you use determines the height of the bars. We recommend using Code39Azalea at 18 points minimum.

You can use Code39Azalea on one computer. You may not resell or redistribute it to others. Please purchase C39Tools if you want to bundle our fonts with your application.

If you want to use Code39Azalea within another application the following function accepts a numeric string and adds the necessary start and stop bar.
